/**
 * Shifting method based algorithm that iterates getting in each step a variable
 * to move it to its best position.
 * What differs from the sifting method proposed by Ruddell is these features.
 * First, we iterates a predefined number of iterations.
 * Second, in each iteration we will be pick the variables to move to its best position in a given order.
 * This order will be gotten from one of the following methods:
 * The variables can be ordered in a descending orderer according to its number of vertices,
 * or randomly. The variable list order is determined by a reinitialization probability in each iteration.
